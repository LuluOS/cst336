        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development methodology for managing product development. It defines "a flexible, holistic product development 
        strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal", challenges assumptions of the "traditional, sequential approach" to product development, 
        and enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication 
        among all team members and disciplines in the project.<br>
        A key principle of scrum is its recognition that during production processes, the customers can change their minds about what they want and need 
        (often called requirements volatility), and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional predictive or planned manner. 
        As such, scrum adopts an empirical approach—accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the 
        team's ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.</p>

        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Agile scrum helps the company in saving time and money.</li>
            <li>Scrum methodology enables project’s where the business requirements documentation is hard to quantify to be successfully developed.</li>
            <li>Fast moving, cutting edge developments can be quickly coded and tested using this method, as a mistake can be easily rectified.</li>
            <li>It is a lightly controlled method which insists on frequent updating of the progress in work through regular meetings. Thus there is clear visibility of the project development.</li>
            <li>Like any other agile methodology, this is also iterative in nature. It requires continuous feedback from the user.</li>
            <li>Due to short sprints and constant feedback, it becomes easier to cope with the changes.</li>
            <li>Daily meetings make it possible to measure individual productivity. This leads to the improvement in the productivity of each of the team members.</li>
            <li>Issues are identified well in advance through the daily meetings and hence can be resolved in speedily.</li>
            <li>It is easier to deliver a quality product in a scheduled time.</li>
            <li>Agile Scrum can work with any technology/ programming language but is particularly useful for fast moving web 2.0 or new media projects.</li>
            <li>The overhead cost in terms of process and management is minimal thus leading to a quicker, cheaper result.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Can be a costly model to use.</li>
            <li>Risk analysis requires highly specific expertise.</li>
            <li>Project’s success is highly dependent on the risk analysis phase.</li>
            <li>Doesn’t work well for smaller projects.</li>
        </ul>
