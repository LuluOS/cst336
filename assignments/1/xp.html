        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent "releases" in short
            development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.
            <br> Other elements of extreme programming include: programming in pairs or doing extensive code review, unit testing of all code, avoiding programming of features until they are actually needed, a flat management structure, simplicity and clarity
            in code, expecting changes in the customer's requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood, and frequent communication with the customer and among programmers. The methodology takes its name from the idea that the beneficial
            elements of traditional software engineering practices are taken to "extreme" levels. As an example, code reviews are considered a beneficial practice; taken to the extreme, code can be reviewed continuously, i.e. the practice of pair programming.</p>

        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Emphasis on customer involvement: A major help to projects where it can be applied.</li>
            <li>Emphasis on teamwork and communication: As with the TSP, this is very important in improving the performance of just about every software team.</li>
            <li>Programmer estimates before committing to a schedule: This helps to establish rational plans and schedules and to get the programmers personally committed to their schedules-a major advantage of XP and TSP.</li>
            <li>Emphasis on responsibility for quality: Unless programmers strive to produce quality products, they probably won’t.</li>
            <li>Continuous measurement: Since software development is a people-intensive process, the principal measures concern people. It is therefore important to involve the programmers in measuring their own work.</li>
            <li>Incremental development: Consistent with most modern development methods.</li>
            <li>Simple design: Though obvious, worth stressing at every opportunity.</li>
            <li>Frequent redesign, or refactoring: A good idea but could be troublesome with any but the smallest projects.</li>
            <li>Having engineers manage functional content: Should help control function creep.</li>
            <li>Frequent, extensive testing: Cannot be overemphasized.</li>
            <li>Continuous reviews: A very important practice that can greatly improve any programming team’s performance (few programmers do reviews at all, let alone continuous reviews).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A methodology is only as effective as the people involved, Agile does not solve this.</li>
            <li>Often used as a means to bleed money from customers through lack of defining a deliverable.</li>
            <li>Lack of structure and necessary documentation.</li>
            <li>Only works with senior-level developers.</li>
            <li>Incorporates insufficient software design.</li>
            <li>Requires meetings at frequent intervals at enormous expense to customers.</li>
            <li>Requires too much cultural change to adopt.</li>
            <li>Can lead to more difficult contractual negotiations.</li>
            <li>Can be very inefficient—if the requirements for one area of code change through various iterations, the same programming may need to be done several times over. Whereas if a plan were there to be followed, a single area of code is expected
                to be written once.</li>
            <li>Impossible to develop realistic estimates of work effort needed to provide a quote, because at the beginning of the project no one knows the entire scope/requirements.</li>
            <li>Can increase the risk of scope creep due to the lack of detailed requirements documentation.</li>
            <li>Agile is feature driven; non-functional quality attributes are hard to be placed as user stories.</li>
        </ul>
